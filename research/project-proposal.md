Final WALK Research Project / PROPOSAL

Final Project Proposal (SEE "FINAL WALK RESEARCH PROJECT" DOCUMENT FOR GUIDLINES AND EXAMPLES)

If you choose NOT to come up with your own proposal and prefer to create within strict outlines, here are two specific proposal options:

Create a portfolio of image and text- 10 images that work together as a group that reference walking somehow, along with a one paragraph statement  describing the intention and inspiration behind the Final WALK Project.  For instance what aspect of walking are you relating to with your project and why? 

Write an abstract (one or two paragraphs) for a 2-3 page paper which poses as specific opinion/ thesis about walking based on your personal interests and interpretations (example: "i fear walking alone at night" or "I do not walk, I roll. I experience the world in a wheelchair" or "the use of the word "walk" implies one moves on two feet and i do not agree with that"). You must relate this opinion/thesis to at least one walking artists' works presented in class as well as 3 references  (readings, videos, etc)
For any proposal, grant, or scholarship application you should always consider CONTENT and FORM. This means....writing clearly about your project idea/ concept  (content) and how (form) you will execute the idea/ project. Form is how, where, what materials, media, or people are needed for your project to succeed. Form considers technical aspects of the project as well. 

If you decide to create your own Proposal (i encourage this option)  try to parallel the level of required effort based on the above options. 

Peer Review for FINAL WALK Proposals are due a few days after FINAL WALK project proposal is due. 

Remember: You will receive Peer Review names on Canvas but you will write reviews on YellowDig.
